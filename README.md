# 🧠 Neural Network from Scratch: Cats vs Dogs

This project showcases a fully custom **feedforward neural network** built entirely with **NumPy** to classify images of cats and dogs. It demonstrates every step manually — from image preprocessing to forward and backward propagation, gradient descent, and prediction — without using any ML libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## 📌 Project Overview

- Preprocess image datasets using Pillow and NumPy
- Construct a two-layer neural network with:
  - **Tanh** activation in the hidden layer
  - **Sigmoid** activation in the output layer (binary classification)
- Implement **manual forward and backward propagation**
- Train using **cross-entropy loss** and **gradient descent**
- Predict on new images and visualize model learning with cost curves

## 🛠️ Features

- ❌ No external ML libraries — just **NumPy**
- 🔧 Configurable hidden layer size (`n_h`)
- 🖼️ Image normalization, reshaping, and flattening
- 📉 Visual cost tracking across iterations
- 🧪 Predict custom user-provided images
